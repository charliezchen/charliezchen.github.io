I am a first-year Computer Science PhD at NYU Courant, working with Prof. [Andrew Gordon Wilson](https://cims.nyu.edu/~andrewgw/). My research interest lies in understanding deep learning models from first principles and speeding up training and inferring for deep neural networks. Prior to this, I finished my Bachelor and Master Degree at NYU, majoring in Math and Computer Science.
